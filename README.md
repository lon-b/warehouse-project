# warehouse-project

---------------------------

This is the **Warehouse Project** that I am doing as a part of the DCI Python Course.

I will periodically update this project, completing tasks and implementing expected features.

Here are some of the potential upcoming features:

- A user system with roles and permissions for listing and placing orders.
- Maintain the stock of a warehouse.
- Order items from the warehouse.
- Log actions from users.
- Reporting.

I'm developing this in VS Code in a virtual environment using Python (3.10.12).
